	<p>Sixth Entry-Cleaning Up
		<br>Today I mostly just cleaned up my website specifically my projects page, adding some icons for new projects, fixing some of them. I made the project icons different cds and I thought that was pretty cool.
	<p>Seventh Entry-Explaining functions
		<br> addEventListener("click", function())
	<p>Eighth Entry-If then statments
		<br> Today, we learned about if else statements and how they work. I want to make something with Astroworld and that color palette and having when you click the color changes from one of the primary colors to the other. I chose the yellow and the blue of the cover. I did this because I really like that album and I wanna incorporate it into my website in some way and this felt like a good way to do it. Throughout the year I hope to use almost all of my favorite albums in some way in my website, so far I have used

	<p>Ninth Entry-Review
		Today, we reviewed a lot of the basics of HTML,css, and js to make sure that we have a solid knowledge of how to use sublime text.
	<p>Tenth Entry-Review(2)
		Today, we actually applied the stuff on the review sheet to actual code. A lot of the javascript stuff that wasn't making sense before is actually starting to make sense now, so that's great. I was also finally able to push my website after months of not being able to, so now my website is up to date.
