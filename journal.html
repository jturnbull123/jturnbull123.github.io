		<br>Today I mostly just cleaned up my website specifically my projects page, adding some icons for new projects, fixing some of them. I made the project icons different cds and I thought that was pretty cool.

	<p>Seventh Entry-If then statments
		<br> Today, we learned about if else statements and how they work. I want to make something with Astroworld and that color palette and having when you click the color changes from one of the primary colors to the other. I chose the yellow and the blue of the cover. I did this because I really like that album and I wanna incorporate it into my website in some way and this felt like a good way to do it.
