	<p>Seventh Entry-Explaining functions
		<br> addEventListener("click", function())
	<p>Eighth Entry-If then statments
		<br> Today, we learned about if else statements and how they work. I want to make something with Astroworld and that color palette and having when you click the color changes from one of the primary colors to the other. I chose the yellow and the blue of the cover. I did this because I really like that album and I wanna incorporate it into my website in some way and this felt like a good way to do it. Throughout the year I hope to use almost all of my favorite albums in some way in my website, so far I have used

			<br> 	E-ecco2k
			<br> 	This is Not a Test-Missy Elliot
